# Php Store

Ecommerce Site

## Description

I wanted to make a simple site that has the potential to be an actual ecommerce store.
I didnt write any code to connect to a DB or have any real dynamic features due to time
but also didnt want site to get overly complex for sample code.

If interested in the results I'll keep working on this site since it was a pretty fun little project. I should have something deployed and up on my [Portfolio Site](http://olonnye.com) by next week.

The whole project is also on my [github](https://github.com/boredasfawk) as well.

FYI-- Most folders are there to give some idea how i want the finaly project to be structured

## Getting Started

- Just put folder where server is stored if local, i.e. '/srv/http/'.
- index.php is starting point

## Main Goals

- have site where users can look through site for clothes they want
- once clothing item is selected user can go a cart to check out

## Stretch Goals

- creat db to store clothing, user info, admin info, etc
- make pages dynamic
- have an admin area where siteowner can make changes
- have log in/out functions
